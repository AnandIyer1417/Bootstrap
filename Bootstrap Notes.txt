    Bootstrap provides pre-built and reusable styles using class names.
    Any components we need we can add the HTML Tag structures and use class names provided from Bootstrap.
    Styles from Bootstrap are responsible and designed with Mobile-first approach


    BREAKPOINTS (6 Types):
        X-Small (xs) , Small (sm) , Medium (md), Large (lg), Extra Large (xl) , Extra Extra Large (xxl) 


    Bootstrap's grid system uses a series of containers, rows and columns to lay out and align content.
    It is built with CSS Flexbox and is fully responsive

    GRID:
        The grid can be made responsive using Breakpoints

        Example of Basic Grid:
            <div class="row">
            <div class="col">1</div>
            <div class="col">2</div>
            <div class="col">3</div>
            <div class="col">4</div>
            </div>
        
        In Bootstrap there screen is divided into 12 parts
        So for col-md-6: In md size, 6/12 = 1/2 
        So two columns i.e. The elements will occupy 50% of screen

        Similarly, for col-lg-3: In lg size, 3/12 = 1/4
        So 4 Columns i.e. The elments will occupy 25% of the screen 

        If a specification is provided that will carry forward for all screen sizes

        For different screen sizes different specifications must be provided or else for diff screens it will look bad.
